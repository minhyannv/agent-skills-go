# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please avoid public disclosure until it has been addressed.

Preferred reporting method:

- Use GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled).
- Otherwise, open a private issue with minimal details and request a secure contact.

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.
